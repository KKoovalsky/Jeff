# **J**ungles' Guitar **Eff**ect

**Jeff** is an open-source, open-hardware digital guitar effect. The major motivation is to create a platform for experimentation with DSP and audio, by having a single hardware where various effects can be flashed. Since it is open-source and open-hardware, it would be a good place to learn DSP audio by doing, and by exploring implementations of guitar effects and the hardware of the device.

The project is in a prototype stage. The first minimal prototype has been constructed and tested. The first effect (and currently, the only one) is distortion. Check out the video, which explains the idea and shows how does the first prototype perform:

## Plans for the future:

* More effects!
* Decrease system noise.
* Create a proper PCB.
* Optimize hardware - use cheaper parts and more cost-effective circuits. 
* Add correction filter for DAC which generates step signal.
* Add knobs, or other type of UI, e.g. touch screen.
* Create a digital multi-effect, with multiple effects flashed onto the device, which can be chained.
